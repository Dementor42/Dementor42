The bot script can **collect bonus and event boxes** efficiently. To collect loot, enable the corresponding setting, make sure the game runs in *2D mode* and set the *ingame settings low*.

## Increase your earnings

To increase your earnings from bonus boxes consider **botting on PVP maps**. On PVP maps such as 4-1, 4-2 and 4-3 you **get 50% more** loot from bonus boxes.

Further increase your earnings by **spending Research Points** on the Pilot Sheet Skill Tree. Skills like _Luck I_, _Luck I_ and _Tractor Beam II_ increase the _Uridium and Extra Energy_ earnings significantly.

Once you collected enough Uridium, a PET drone might be a good investment. But solely having a PET using the _autolooter-gear_ won't increase your earnings by much. You really want to buy as much _Salvage Protocols_ as possible to eventually **get 36% more** out of boxes collected by your PET.
