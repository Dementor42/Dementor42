The bot script can **hunt NPCs on lower maps** efficiently using latest pixel bot technology. To hunt NPCs, enable the corresponding setting, turn your games *settings to low* and switch to *2D mode*.

Keep in mind that the NPC hunter is still considered an experimental feature. It's still under development has so far solely been *tested on X-2 maps*.
